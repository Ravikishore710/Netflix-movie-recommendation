## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
  Cleans the dataset, handles missing values, and selects relevant columns.

- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Visualizes user behavior and content trends using plots and correlation heatmaps.

- 🧠 **Matrix Factorization (SVD)**  
  Applies Singular Value Decomposition to uncover latent user-item interactions.

- 🤝 **Collaborative Filtering**  
  Recommends content based on user-user and item-item similarity.

- 🧮 **Cosine Similarity Engine**  
  Computes similarity between movies for more accurate recommendations.

- 📉 **Evaluation Metrics**  
  Includes RMSE for performance evaluation and visual error analysis.
