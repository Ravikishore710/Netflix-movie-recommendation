# Netflix Recommendation System

A machine learning-powered **movie recommendation system** inspired by Netflix, built using collaborative filtering and matrix factorization techniques. This project predicts user preferences based on historical ratings to generate personalized movie recommendations.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
  Cleans the dataset, handles missing values, and selects relevant columns.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Visualizes user behavior and content trends using plots and correlation heatmaps.

- **Matrix Factorization (SVD)**  
  Applies Singular Value Decomposition to uncover latent user-item interactions.

- **Collaborative Filtering**  
  Recommends content based on user-user and item-item similarity.

- **Cosine Similarity Engine**  
  Computes similarity between movies for more accurate recommendations.

- **Evaluation Metrics**  
  Includes RMSE for performance evaluation and visual error analysis.

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** & **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **SciPy**

## Dataset

The dataset contains anonymized Netflix user ratings. It has been preprocessed to remove noise and irrelevant columns.

- 📁 File: `netflixData.csv`

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ravikishore710/netflix-recommendation-system.git
    cd netflix-recommendation-system
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the notebook:
    Open `Netflix_Rec_final.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Colab and execute step by step.

## Future Improvements

- Integrate content-based filtering (using genres, cast, etc.)
- Hybrid recommender (combine collaborative + content-based)
- Web UI for real-time recommendations

---

## Inspiration

Inspired by the Netflix Prize challenge and modern recommender system research.
